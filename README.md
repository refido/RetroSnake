Welcome to the Retro Snake game! This classic game brings back the nostalgia of the old-school arcade era. In this game, you control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The objective is to navigate the snake around the game board, avoiding obstacles and the snake's own body, while collecting as much food as possible.

The game features simple controls, with the snake moving in four directions: up, down, left, and right. As the snake consumes food, it grows longer, making it more challenging to maneuver without colliding with itself or the walls.

Retro Snake offers a thrilling and addictive gameplay experience, testing your reflexes, strategy, and ability to think ahead. Can you guide the snake to become the longest and most skilled player?

Get ready to embark on a journey down memory lane with Retro Snake!
